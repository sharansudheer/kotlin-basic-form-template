## Template App

### This is for the freelancers/university buddies out there

This is a Java based Native app template following The MVVM Architecture, one Main Activity and sub fragraments. One main activity and many sub fragments works better with Kotlin-coroutines and kotlin navgraph.

#### I am just learning Kotlin so bare with me for a while, I will finish this Java app first and then the Kotlin version

### Included - 
1. Retrofit Integration
2. Data Store integration
3. Firebase Fragment

5. Material UI 3

And more to be updated
